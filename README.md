## Introduction

Customer churn occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. This project aims to:
1. Analyze factors influencing churn.
2. Build predictive models to classify customers as churners or non-churners.
3. Provide actionable insights based on model outcomes.

## Features and Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
  - Normalize/scale numerical features for better model performance.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualize trends, correlations, and distributions.
  - Identify key features impacting churn.

- **Model Development**:
  - Implement machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and others.
  - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Insights**:
  - Highlight patterns and actionable recommendations to reduce churn.
